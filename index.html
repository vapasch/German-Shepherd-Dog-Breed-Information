        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hip and Elbow Dysplasia:</strong> This is a common problem in large dogs where the joint doesn't form properly, leading to arthritis and mobility issues.</li>

        <h2>Living Environment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Space:</strong> German Shepherds thrive in homes with a large yard or open space to run and play. However, they can adapt to apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.</li>

    </div>

    <div id="diet-and-nutrition" class="dog">
        <h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2>
        <p class="palign">A German Shepherd's diet should be high in protein to support their muscles and energy needs. Depending on their age, activity level, and weight, their food intake may vary, but generally, they need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2-3 cups of high-quality dry dog food</strong> split into two meals a day for adults.</li>
            <li>Puppies and highly active dogs may require more.</li>
